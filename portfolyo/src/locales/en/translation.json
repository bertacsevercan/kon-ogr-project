As a team we used SCRUM for the first time to develop our application rapidly in 3 weeks. The application's purpose was to manage the inventory of a restaurant (Tina Zita). Our goal was to make M.Y-Inventory easy to use and we also added an enhanced mobile user experience for  different possible use cases. The application also supports three different languages; English, Turkish and Arabic.",
      "text1": "The purpose of this website was to collect food coupon donations for the people in need. This project was the closest one to a real-life company project because we had a lead-engineer and we used SCRUM for development. We used ReactJS for development, Firebase to store data and Ant Design for styling. We've used Stripe API to handle payments, ChartJS for graphs, Wordpress API for our blog, i18next for language support. We've also worked with a UI/UX designer for our designs and used Figma.",
      "text2": "The purpose of this project was to create a board app which is similar to a to-do app. My partner and I decided to do a weekly-workout-planning app. In this project, I've used ReactJS for the first time and it was such a good practice for me to understand React. I've also used Ant Design to style the application and used Google's Firebase to store user data.",
      "text3": "This project was similar to the IMDb website which you can search for movies, actors and see popular movies, tv shows etc. In this project, my partner and I've used object-oriented programming and MovieDb API to fetch the necessary movie data. Also, I used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap with CSS for styling.",
      "text4": "The purpose of the website is to play mad libs. It also has Turkish and English language support. It can save your words by using local storage.  For the first time, I did pair programming and worked on a project with a partner and it was my first ever vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS project. Also, it was the first time that I learned about and worked with regular expressions, i18next library, local storage. The style of the project was purely CSS. I didn't use any frameworks for styling.",
      "text5": "This is a simple full stack project to practice Express js and REST API with TypeORM. The app simply invites people to my graduation from the Re:Coded Bootcamp.",
      "text6": "This is a JetBrains Academy project which contains various matrix operations including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices.",
      "text7": "This is a JetBrains Academy project which contains a financial loan-credit calculator. The first stages of the project was getting input from the user and was running from the console. At the last stage, it switched to a CLI program and ran from the terminal.",
      "text8": "This is a JetBrains Academy project and it's a simple game of hangman.",
      "text9": "This is a JetBrains Academy project and it's a 2-player game of tic tac toe.",
      "text10": "This is a JetBrains Academy project and it's a game of rock paper scissors.",
      "text11": "This is a JetBrains Academy project and In this project, I have created a smart calculator which the user can do basic operations with an order of precedence. It's also smart enough to remember previous calculations.",
      "text12": "This is a JetBrains Academy project which you can play a game of tic-tac-toe against different levels of AI, such as easy, medium and hard. It's also two-player and AIs can play with each other.",
      "text13": "This is a JetBrains Academy project. It's a CLI program that can process different languages with the help of Reverso-Context website. You can type in the word and the language to be translated and it shows the word synonyms and example sentences."

I also attended and graduated from Re: Coded Web development Bootcamp(uses Flatiron School's curriculum) where I gained my skills in front-end web development.",
      "text1": "Before the Bootcamp, I started programming in Java at Bilgi University. Then I learned about SQL and RDBMS there. To improve my skills in programming, I started to learn Python myself and loved it. When I started the Re: Coded Bootcamp, I didn't know about web development and that was where I first learned about it. We started with HTML and CSS, then moved on with JavaScript. Lastly, we finished with ReactJS and I also got the chance to learn about SCRUM and experience it first hand in the capstone project.",
      "text2": "In my time within the Bootcamp, I've learned many new skills and knowledge. I've learned about Git and VCS and how important it was for my career. Also, I've worked on many projects with different partners during this time. I even formed a group of developers from the Bootcamp and attended a hackathon where we got 3'rd overall with our web-app: M.Y-Inventory. Also, right before I joined the Bootcamp, I formed my online study-group called 'Çaylak Kodcular' (Rookie Coders). It was a Discord channel open to anyone who wanted to learn about programming. From this experience, I've both gained a lot and I tried to give back too.",
      "text3": "The reason I fell in love with programming is how creative it can be, it allowed me to build something from nothing. I also realized when I started programming, I love solving problems. One time, I was working on a project, I spent my entire day working on solving the problem I had and I didn't even get bored and that's when I realized I can do this without hesitation.",
      "text4": "I'm interested in all sorts of development; mobile, web, software, video-game. But one of my goals is to build my own video-game someday. As you can easily guess from this, I love playing video-games but mostly story-driven ones.",
      "text5": "The other thing I love as much as programming is music. I play three different instruments; piano, drums, guitar and I'd like to combine my love for programming and music one day. Oh, and I also do CrossFit and I have a Level-1 trainer certificate in CrossFit. But I don't want to be that guy who talks about CrossFit all the time so I'll stop ",
